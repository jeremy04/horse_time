Mobile NHL drafting application for the drinking game "horses"

#### How it works

The Drinking game horses involves a group of more than 2 people who draft horses (NHL players) 
who might score goals for that game. If your horse scores a goal, you can give out a shot to another player. 
If your horse gets an assist, you can give out half a shot.

The reason I made this application was to help my friends manage it all. We normally use pen and paper.

This app gives you:
   - automatic snake drafting
   - real-time updates of goals, 
   - accurate roster selection.

### How to play

One person creates the new room.
A 4-digit random code will be generated, and you give the code to your buddies as the "password" to the room.
The first person who logs in will be taken to a lobby and be deemed the "Manager".

The manager can start the game until everyone is in the room, and pick which NHL game they want to play horses with.

After everybody's in, the draft starts, and the pick order is randomly selected.

Depending on how many horses are configured (default is 2 per team), each player will draft until everyone has picked.

After the draft is over, the game will auto-refresh and update the page with goal stats and shot totals.
